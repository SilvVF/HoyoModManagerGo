# Setup

Go to settings and select the Mods folder. It is recommended to create a new folder within 3dmigoto/Mods (e.g., create Mods/managed) to use as this folder. This will decrease the work done when unzipping as no other folders need to be checked.

If you have any previous mods inside the folder that you want to keep, do the following:
Settings > + Add Exclusion Directory > Select any folders that should not be deleted.

All mods are kept inside C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\HoyoModManagerGo\cache (USER being your user). If space saver is enabled, all mods will be stored in .zip files. To delete all data after deleting the app, delete the root of this folder.
