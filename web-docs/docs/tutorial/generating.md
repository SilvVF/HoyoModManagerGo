# Generating

To update the mods folder after toggling the checkboxes, click the "Generate" button. This will go through the mods that you have enabled and unzip them into the export Directory selected in Settings.

**THIS WILL CLEAR THE FOLDER IF AN EXCLUSION IS NOT SET AND CLEAN EXPORT DIR IS ON (To set this go to settings or see setup)**

It will also fill any keymaps or textures that are selected for the mod.
